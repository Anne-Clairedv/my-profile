			<h2>Digital Marketing 📱</h2>
			<p>
			I'm really interested in digital marketing. I like that it is always changing and that you have to learn new things everyday to adapt to the evolution of each system. I believe digital marketing can help achieve many goals and that it is a very interesting tool to use to get your word across.

			<h2>Data Science 📊</h2>
			<p>
			"Data is the new oil". It is thus important to know how to use it to your best advantage. Data can help balance any decision and can help you understand your customer better and ultimately serve them better. Combined with digital marketing, it is a very interesting tool to master.

			<h2>Artificial intelligence 🤖</h2>
			<p>
			Artificial intelligence is an ever-changing and revolutionary technology. I took an interest in this complex but fascinating technology and wrote my first memoir on the future of AI. Technology changes have spurred anxiety about employment for decades as machine threaten to replace human work. The overall effect of artificial intelligence on the market’s labour demand is still ambiguous and there is no consensus among authors. In the past technologies and innovation were seen as the main drivers of economic growth and new employment. Will we see this trend emerging again or will it be different this time?

			<h2>Travel 🗺️</h2>
			<p>
			I'm passionate about travelling. Since I was a kid I always enjoyed travelling and it hasn't changed. Travelling is a way to broaden my mind, learn about a new culture, meet new people, discover new landscapes, be surprised and grow.
